🚀 Daily DSA & LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my daily coding practice solutions from LeetCode and other DSA problems.
I’m solving at least 1 problem every day to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for interviews.

📌 Goals

Solve problems daily (Easy → Medium → Hard)

Cover all major DSA topics (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)

Writing clean, optimized, and well-documented code.

🔥 Motivation
“It's either day 1 or one day 🚀”
